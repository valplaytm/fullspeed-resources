Fullspeed is a substyle in Trackmania where driving happen on maps that allows players to hold gas throughout the entire track without drifting, releasing, braking or crashing. The essential element of Fullspeed is the speed and momentum that you build up through the track until the finish line.

The speed you accumulate in different sections of the tracks snowballs throughout the entire track, giving players an incredible amount of speed, sometimes even reaching the absolute maximum amount of speed the car can drive.

## How to Approach Fullspeed
While playing Fullspeed it can be quite de-motivating when you feel like you drive the map well and is taking the same lines as the top players, but you're still 1-2 seconds behind their final times.

Because of how momentum based the style is, even the smallest differences can give a huge impact by the time you reach the end of the track. You should realize that the time differences doesn't always mean you did a bad run. But rather think about the small tiny differences the way you play the track compared to the top players.

Fullspeed is a style where the tinest of details matter, and with so many small details to consider, the impact they make can be huge when summed up together. These details can be overwhelming for beginners. I suggest therefore to take everything progressively. Focus first on driving the maps smooth, take the shortest paths and avoid sliding too much. Getting these 3 things down will already give you a huge advantage.

When playing Fullspeed, focus on the details but avoid overcomplicating. Drive more direct lines. Fullspeed is about driving everything as smooth as possible, which usually means minimizing the amount of steering you do. It's sort of like simplifying everything to avoid as much steering as possible.

Sometimes the weirdest lines are the fastest ways to approach a section in a fullspeed track. These are not very obvious. When figuring out a map, try different approaches, different lines, even try stuff that doesn't seem to be the best way. This gives you a much better understanding of the map and fullspeed in general than just copying other's lines.

Since fullspeed is all about momentum and snowballing your speed throughout the entire map, the speed is your number one metric for how well you are driving the different sections. Get used to keep an eye on your speed throughout the entire map.

## Best Ways to Practice

First of all, play the game and have fun. The best way to improve on fullspeed is to find the maps you enjoy and play them alot.

Driving fullspeed is alot about a good combination of intuition and muscle memory. You gain inutition by playing alot of maps, experimenting, trying things and failing, just generally expose yourself to as many different scenarios as possible. Muscle memory comes from repetition, playing the same sections or maps over and over.

Because of this, you should not just do one thing, like don't just play on online servers, or don't just hunt a single map the whole day. Give yourself some variety, play a bunch of maps online, hunt a map for a few hours, open the editor and create something to practice over and over until you get it or discover new techniques.

Improving on fullspeed is all about your own effort, whenever you play, get into the mindset of constantly asking the questions "what went right here?" and "what went wrong here?".

Competitions can be one of the best ways to improve on fullspeed. They give you a goal that to go for, you connect with the community and it is generally a fun way to engage with the game.

Motivation is also an important factor, forget trying to reach the top players, but instead set yourself small goals like improving your PB by .1 on a map. Improve from yourself, not others.

So what do you focus on when practicing fullspeed? Your speed. Get an understanding of how you lose and gain speed, as well as how fast you accelerate. Learn how even speed affects itself. For example driving up a hill decreases your acceleration, but with more speed, you reach the top faster, and can accelerate again quicker, giving you the snowball effect of just accelerating your speed even more.

In fullspeed, you want to generally practice things that gives you the most acceleration and speed or least speed loss.
