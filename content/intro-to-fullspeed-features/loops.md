## Types of loopings
Loopings can be of multiple kinds. The kinds you'll encounter the most are
[sideways loopings](sideways-loopings) and [simple loopings](simpole-loopings).
Sometimes, the entries and exits of these more basic loopings are mixed
together to create more complicated loopings ; these variations will be
refered to as [custom loopings](#custom-loopings).
